# **bdd-gherkin-api-test-automation-demo**

### Description:

Automated CRUD ( i.e., `POST`, `GET`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` ) operations using `pytest` and `pytest-bdd`

### Prerequisites:

- `requests` `pytest` `pytest-bdd`

### Installation Steps:

In order to get the tests to run locally, you need to install the following pieces of software.

###### NOTE: All commands shall be executed from Automation Project root directory:

`../[PROJECT_DIR]/tests/`.

#### MacOS

- Install Homebrew with `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
    - Fix commandline `sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target /`
- Install Pyenv with `brew install pyenv`, This is a python version manager.
- Add the following to `~/.bash_profile`
```.env
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/shims:$PATH"
export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/completions/pyenv.bash:$PATH"
```
- Install python 3.8.2 with `pyenv install 3.8.2`
- Set python version 3.8.2 to be used globally with `pyenv global 3.8.2`
- Install virtualenv with `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`
- Create new virtual env with `python3 -m virtualenv .venv`
- Activate new virtual env with `source ./.venv/bin/activate`
- Install all project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check python version used with `which python`, Shall be `[PROJECT_DIR]/tests/.venv/bin/python`.

#### Windows / Linux

- Install GitBash
- Uninstall any previous python version
- Install python 3.8.2 using official installation file
- Install all project dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`


### Project Contents:

`tests/` directory contains `features/` and `step_definitions/` sub-directories.

`features/sample.feature` file contains BDD Scenarios ( i.e., BDD statements )

`step_definitions/test_sample.py` file contains corresponding step implementation of `sample.feature` file for each of the BDD statements.

### Test Execution:

- Fork the repo `bdd-gherkin-api-test-automation-demo`
- Clone the repo to your local
- Open Pycharm (or any IDE) > File > Open > Open the project where the repository is located ( i.e., `../bdd-gherkin-test-automation-demo/tests`)
- Run the command: `pytest -vv --gherkin-terminal-reporter --reruns 1 --reruns-delay 1 --tags="automated"`


### Output:

    Scenario: POST example
        Given I set sample REST API URL
        And I set header param request content type as "application/json"
        Given I set "POST" posts api endpoint
